**Gain insight into your models!**

When fitting any statistical model, there are many useful pieces of information that are simultaneously calculated and stored beyond coefficient estimates and general model fit statistics. Although there exist some generic functions to obtain model information and data, many package-specific modeling functions do not provide such methods to allow users to access such valuable information. 

**insight** is an R-package that fills this important gap by providing a suite of functions to support almost any model (see a list of the many models supported below in the **List of Supported Packages and Models** section). The goal of **insight**, then, is to provide tools to provide *easy*, *intuitive*, and *consistent* access to information contained in model objects. These tools aid applied research in virtually any field who fit, diagnose, and present statistical models by streamlining access to every aspect of many model objects via consistent syntax and output.

Built with non-programmers in mind, **insight** offers a broad toolbox for making model and data information easily accessible. While **insight** offers many useful functions for working with and understanding model objects (discussed below), we suggest users start with `model_info()`, as this function provides a clean and consistent overview of model objects (*e.g.*, functional form of the model, the model family, link function, number of observations, variables included in the specification, etc.). With a clear understanding of the model introduced, users are able to adapt other functions for more nuanced exploration of and interaction with virtually any model object. 

## What is a model?

A statistical model is an object describing the relationship between variables. Although there are a lot of *different types* of models, each with their specificities, most of them also share some *common components*. The goal of **insight** is to help you retrieve these components.

Such components are:

* **data**: the dataset used to fit the model.
* **response**: the outcome or response variable (dependent variable) of a regression model.
* **predictor**: independent variables of (the _fixed_ part of) a regression model. For mixed models, variables that are (only) in the _random effects_ part of the model are not returned as predictors by default, however, these can be returned using additional arguments to the function call. Predictors are "unqiue", hence if a variable appears as fixed effect and random slope, it is considered as one predictor (it is the same variable).
* **parameters**: values estimated or learned from data that encapsulate the relationship between variables. In regressions, these are usually referred to as *coefficients*.
* **term**: terms are any (unique) variables that appear in a regression model, like response variable, predictors or random effects. A "term" only relates to the unique occurence of a variable. For instance, in the expression `x + I(x^2)`, there is only the term `x`.
* **variables**: A variable is considered as an object that stores unique data information. For instance, the expression `x + I(x^2)` has two objects with two different sets of data values, and thus are treated as two variables.
* **random slopes**: variables that are used as random slope in a mixed effects model.
* **random or grouping factors**: variables that are used as grouping variables in a mixed effects model.

*Aren't the predictors, terms and parameters the same thing?*

In some cases, yes. But not in all cases. Find out more by [**clicking here to access the documentation**](https://easystats.github.io/insight/articles/insight.html).

The package revolves around two key prefixes: `get_*` and `find_*`. The `get_*` prefix extracts *values* (or *data*) associated with model-specific objects (e.g., parameters or variables), while the `find_*` prefix *lists* model-specific objects (e.g., priors or predictors). These are powerful families of functions allowing for great flexibility in use, whether at a high, descriptive level (`find_*`) or narrower level of statistical inspection and reporting (`get_*`).

## Functions

In total, the **insight** package includes 16 core functions: [get_data()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/get_data.html), [get_priors()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/get_priors.html), [get_variance()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/get_variance.html), [get_parameters()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/get_parameters.html), [get_predictors()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/get_predictors.html), [get_random()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/get_random.html), [get_response()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/get_response.html), [find_algorithm()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/find_algorithm.html), [find_formula()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/find_formula.html), [find_variables()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/find_variables.html), [find_terms()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/find_terms.html), [find_parameters()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/find_parameters.html), [find_predictors()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/find_predictors.html), [find_random()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/find_random.html), [find_response()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/find_response.html), and [model_info()](https://easystats.github.io/insight/reference/model_info.html). In all cases, users must supply at a minimum, the name of the model fit object. In several functions, there are additional arguments that allow for more targeted returns of model information. For example, the `find_terms()` function's `effects` argument allows for the extraction of "fixed effects" terms, "random effects" terms, or by default, "all" terms in the model object. We point users to the package documentation or the complementary package website, https://easystats.github.io/insight/, for a detailed list of the arguments associated with each function as well as the returned values from each function.
