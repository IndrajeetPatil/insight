Title: Easy Access to Model Information for Various Model Objects
Description: Although there are generic functions to get information
    and data from models, many modelling-functions from different
    packages do not provide methods to access these information.
    The **insight** package aims at closing this gap by providing 
    functions that work for (almost) any models.
