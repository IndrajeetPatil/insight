Title: Easily Access Model Information for Various Model Objects
Description: Although there are generic functions to get information about or 
  data from models, many modelling-functions from different packages do not
  provide methods to access these information. 'insight' aims to close this 
  gap by providing functions that work for (almost) any model object.
