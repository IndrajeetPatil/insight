When fitting any statistical model, there are many useful pieces of information that are simultaneously calculated and stored beyond coefficient estimates and general model fit statistics. Although there exist some generic functions to obtain model information and data, many package-specific modeling functions do not provide such methods to allow users to access such valuable information. 

**insight** is an R-package that fills this important gap by providing a suite of functions to support almost any model. The goal of **insight**, then, is to provide tools to provide *easy*, *intuitive*, and *consistent* access to information contained in model objects. These tools aid applied research in virtually any field who fit, diagnose, and present statistical models by streamlining access to every aspect of many model objects via consistent syntax and output.

Built with non-programmers in mind, *insight* offers a broad toolbox for making model and data information easily accessible. While *insight* offers many useful functions for working with and understanding model objects (discussed below), we suggest users start with `model_info()`, as this function provides a clean and consistent overview of model objects (*e.g.*, functional form of the model, the model family, link function, number of observations, variables included in the specification, etc.). With a clear understanding of the model introduced, users are able to adapt other functions for more nuanced exploration of and interaction with virtually any model object.

## Overview of Core Functions

A statistical model is an object describing the relationship between variables. Although there are a lot of *different types* of models, each with their specificities, most of them also share some *common components*. The goal of **insight** is to help you retrieve these components.

The `get_*` prefix extracts *values* (or *data*) associated with model-specific objects (e.g., parameters or variables), while the `find_*` prefix *lists* model-specific objects (e.g., priors or predictors). These are powerful families of functions allowing for great flexibility in use, whether at a high, descriptive level (`find_*`) or narrower level of statistical inspection and reporting (`get_*`). We point users to the package documentation or the complementary package website, https://easystats.github.io/insight/, for a detailed list of the arguments associated with each function as well as the returned values from each function.

## Definition of Model Components

The functions from **insight** address different components of a model. In an effort to avoid confusion about specific "targets" of each function, in this section we provide a short explanation of *insight*'s definitions of regression model components.

* **data**: the dataset used to fit the model.
* **response**: the outcome or response variable (dependent variable) of a regression model.
* **predictor**: independent variables of (the _fixed_ part of) a regression model. For mixed models, variables that are only in the _random effects_ part (i.e. grouping factors) of the model are not returned as predictors by default. However, these can be included using additional arguments in the function call, treating predictors are "unqiue." As such, if a variable appears as a fixed effect and a random slope, it is treated as one (the same) predictor.
* **random slopes**: variables that are specified as random slopes in a mixed effects model.
* **random or grouping factors**: variables that are specified as grouping variables in a mixed effects model.
* **parameters**: values estimated or learned from data that capture the relationship between variables. In regression models, these are usually referred to as *coefficients*.


```{r out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("insight_design_2.png", dpi = 72)
```

* **term**: any unique variables that appear in a regression model, e.g., response variables, predictors or random effects. A "term" only relates to the unique occurence of a variable. For instance, the expression `x + I(x^2)` has only the term `x`.
* **variables**: an object that stores unique data information. For instance, the expression `x + I(x^2)` has two objects with two different sets of data values, and thus are treated as two variables.

```

## Examples

*Aren't the predictors, terms, and parameters the same thing?*

In some cases, yes. But not in all cases, and sometimes it is useful to have the "bare" variable names (terms), but sometimes it is also useful to have the information about a possible transformation of variables. That is the main reason for having functions that cover similar aspects of a model object (like `find_variables()` and `find_predictors()` or `find_terms()`).

Here are some examples that demonstrate the differences of each function:

```{r echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(insight)
library(lme4)
data(sleepstudy)
sleepstudy$mygrp <- sample(1:5, size = 180, replace = TRUE)
sleepstudy$mysubgrp <- NA
sleepstudy$Weeks <- sleepstudy$Days / 7
sleepstudy$cat <- as.factor(sample(letters[1:4], nrow(sleepstudy), replace = TRUE))

for (i in 1:5) {
  filter_group <- sleepstudy$mygrp == i
  sleepstudy$mysubgrp[filter_group] <-
    sample(1:30, size = sum(filter_group), replace = TRUE)
}

model <- lmer(
  Reaction ~ Days + I(Days^2) + log1p(Weeks) + cat +
    (1 | mygrp / mysubgrp) + 
    (1 + Days | Subject),
  data = sleepstudy
)
```


```{r echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# find the response variable
find_response(model)

# find all predictors, fixed part by default
find_predictors(model)

# find random effects, grouping factors only
find_random(model)

# find random slopes
find_random_slopes(model)

# find all predictors, including random effects
find_predictors(model, effects = "all", component = "all")

# find all terms, including response and random effects
# this is essentially the same as the previous example plus response
find_terms(model)

# find all variables, i.e. also quadratic or log-transformed predictors
find_variables(model)
```

Finally, there is `find_parameters()`. Parameters are also known as *coefficients*, and `find_parameters()` does exactly that: returns the model coefficients.

```{r echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# find model parameters, i.e. coefficients
find_parameters(model)
```
