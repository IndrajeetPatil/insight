When fitting any statistical model, there are many useful pieces of information that are simultaneously calculated and stored beyond coefficient estimates and general model fit statistics. Although there exist some generic functions to obtain model information and data, many package-specific modeling functions do not provide such methods to allow users to access such valuable information. 

*insight* is an R-package that fills this important gap by providing a suite of functions to support almost any model. The goal of *insight*, then, is to provide tools to provide *easy*, *intuitive*, and *consistent* access to information contained in model objects. 

Built with non-programmers in mind, *insight* offers a broad toolbox for making model and data information easily accessible, revolving around two key prefixes: `get_*` and `find_*`. 

Generally, the `get_*` prefix extracts values associated with model-specific objects (e.g., parameters or algorithms), while the `find_*` prefix lists model-specific objects (e.g., priors and predictors). We point users to the package documentation or the complementary package website, https://easystats.github.io/insight/, for a detailed list of the arguments associated with each function as well as the returned values from each function.
