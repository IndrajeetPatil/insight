This release includes some bug fixes and various improvements. Furthermore, there are two points which affect other packages on CRAN:

1) This release fixes an issue with the latest 'brms'-update that breaks tests in the 'bayestestR'-package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_bayestestR.html). We expect that those errors will be solved once the 'insght'-update is released on CRAN.

2) This submission will break some tests of the 'parameters'-package, i.e. we expect some of the reverse-dependency checks to fail. This is of less of concern, because the affected funtions in 'parameters' still work. E.g., one tests fails because 'BFBayesFactor::anovaBF()' was not supported before (and hence, the test expects an error), but due to this 'insight'-update, these objects now also work in 'parameters', that's why the test now "fails" (because there is no longer an error in the test-result). 

We have prepared an update for the 'parameters'-package, which we can submit once the 'insight'-update is on CRAN. We excuse this "cyclic" dependency during the submission-process, but we'd kindly ask to first submit 'insight', then 'parameters', because 'parameters' depends on (new) functions from the 'insight' package.

Best Regards
Daniel LÃ¼decke, maintainer of the 'insight' and 'parameters' packages.
