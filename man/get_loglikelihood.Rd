\usage{
get_loglikelihood(x, estimator = "ML", summarize = TRUE, ...)

loglikelihood(x, estimator = "ML", summarize = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A model.}

\item{estimator}{Corresponds to the different estimators for the standard deviation of the errors. If \code{estimator="ML"} (default), the scaling is done by n (the biased ML estimator), which is then equivalent to using \code{stats::logLik()}. If \code{estimator="OLS"}, it returns the unbiased OLS estimator (scaling by the degrees of freedom, i.e., \code{nâˆ’k}). In moderately large samples, the differences should be negligible, but it is possible that OLS would perform slightly better in small samples with Gaussian errors. See also \href{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/155474/why-does-lrtest-not-match-anovatest-lrt}{this thread} about a concrete application of these variants.}

\item{summarize}{Currently not used.}

\item{...}{Not used.}

\description{
A robust function to compute the log-likelihood of a model. Can be used as a replacement for \code{stats::logLik()} out of the box, as the returned object is of the same class (and it gives the same results when \code{estimator = "ML"} is specified).

\examples{
x <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Width + Species, data=iris)

get_loglikelihood(x, estimator = "ML")  # Equivalent to stats::logLik(x)
get_loglikelihood(x, estimator = "OLS")
}
